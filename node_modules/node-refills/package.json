  "readme": "# Refills\n\n## Prepackaged patterns and components, built on top of Bourbon, Bitters and Neat\n\n# Requirements\n- [node](http://nodejs.org)\n- [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com) -or- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) -or- [node-sass](https://github.com/andrew/node-sass)\n\n# Installation\n\nTo install as a development dependency, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev node-refills\n```\n\nIf you need it in production, replace `--save-dev` with `--save`.\n\nIf a component/pattern has JavaScript it is placed in the HTML.erb file. Feel free to place it somewhere else in your project.\n\n# Using Refills\n\n#### Scss\n\nAll components/pattern should be fully responsive and follow the [Neat examples](http://neat.bourbon.io/examples).\n\nAvoid more than 2 levels of nesting for clarity and legibility of code.\n\nTry to use as little styling as possible. Use the styles that come with Bitters to keep everything consistent.\n\nPut media queries inline, don’t separate them since that will create a lot of repetitions of class names. If needed, for the sake of clarity, create a specific variable for a media query if a certain breakpoint changes the component/pattern drastically:\n\n```scss\n$tab-mode: $medium-screen;\n\n@include media($tab-mode) { // $tab-mode is the same as $medium-screen here\n  border-radius: 0;\n}\n```\n\nCreate variables for any color or size that might appear in a refill, especially if it appears more than once in the component/pattern.\n\nDeclare the variables inside of the component/pattern’s class like below. Note that variables should be interdependent to enable quick restyling.\n\n```scss\n.card {\n  $card-border-color: $base-border-color;\n  $card-border: 1px solid $card-border-color;\n  $card-background: lighten($card-border-color, 10);\n  &hellip;\n```\n\n# Credits\n\n![thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/images/tm/logo.png)\n\nRefills is maintained and funded by [thoughtbot, inc](http://thoughtbot.com).
